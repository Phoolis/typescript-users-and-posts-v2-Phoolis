> I hope you're doing well. I have another important task that requires your attention, this time related to sorting our users by their registration date.
> 
> As part of our ongoing improvements to our platform, we've encountered a unique challenge with the `registeredAt` attribute in our user records. The `registeredAt` attribute stores the registration date for each user. However, we've noticed that different users have different data types for this attribute. Users who registered through our mobile app have an integer value representing the epoch timestamp, while users who registered through the web app have a string in ISO format. It's crucial that we sort all users in ascending order by their registration date, regardless of the data type inconsistency.
> 
> **Implementation Approach**: In this case, you are allowed to utilize the pre-existing `sort` method. However, I encourage you to reuse the sorting logic that you previously used when sorting posts, as it will save time and effort.
> 
> **Unit Tests**: Similar to the previous task, we've already prepared unit tests for your code. These tests will help guide you in implementing the sorting logic and ensure that your solution meets our expectations. Having these tests in place will also allow us to catch any issues early in the development process.
> 
> Your task is to create a new function that accepts an array of users and returns the sorted array in ascending order based on their registration date. It's essential that your implementation handles the different data types (integer and string) for the `registeredAt` attribute without modifying the user records.
> 
> This task, while somewhat complex due to the data type variations, is crucial for enhancing the user experience on our platform. Sorting users by their registration date will help us better understand user behavior and tailor our services accordingly.
> 
> Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or need additional information while working on this task. Your skills and expertise are invaluable to our team, and I have full confidence in your ability to tackle this challenge effectively.
> 
> Thank you for your dedication to our project, and I look forward to seeing your solution in action.

> P.S. Here are examples of the different types of `registeredAt` values for users:
> 
> 1. **Epoch Timestamp (Integer)**:
>    - User 1: Registered at 1632218400 (Represents September 21, 2021, at 12:00:00 UTC)
>    - User 2: Registered at 1663754400 (Represents February 19, 2023, at 12:00:00 UTC)
> 
> 2. **ISO Format (String)**:
>    - User 3: Registered at "2022-08-15T18:30:00Z" (Represents August 15, 2022, at 18:30:00 UTC)
>    - User 4: Registered at "2023-04-10T09:45:00Z" (Represents April 10, 2023, at 09:45:00 UTC)
> 
> These examples demonstrate the variation in the `registeredAt` attribute's data types, with some users having integer values (epoch timestamps) and others having string values (in ISO 8601 format). The sorting function should be able to handle both formats and sort the users in ascending order based on their registration date correctly.
