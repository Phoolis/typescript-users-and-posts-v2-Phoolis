> Subject: Refactoring Request: Improve User Name and Post Title Printing Logic
>
> Dear [Developer's Name],
> 
> I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to discuss an important refactoring task that we need to address in our current codebase. Specifically, I'd like to improve the implementation for printing out users' names and post titles.
> 
> The existing implementation, as you may already know, relies heavily on nested for-loops and console logs. While this approach may have sufficed initially, it has become increasingly difficult to maintain and test as our codebase has grown. Moreover, this implementation lacks the flexibility required to support our evolving features, especially when it comes to reuse across different parts of our application, such as the mobile app and website.
> 
> To address these challenges, I propose refactoring the current implementation as follows:
> 
> 1. **Encapsulation**: We should encapsulate the logic for printing user names and post titles within a dedicated function.
> 
> 2. **Return Value**: This function should return the result as a return value, making it more versatile and suitable for reuse in various parts of our application.
> 
> 3. **Testing**: By encapsulating the logic, we'll make it significantly easier to write unit tests. This will help us ensure the correctness of this functionality, catch potential bugs early in development, and maintain a higher level of code quality.
> 
> I'm pleased to inform you that we already have the initial setup in place. We have created an empty function for this purpose, along with the necessary tests to guide you in implementing the logic. Your task will primarily involve adding the appropriate logic within this function to achieve the desired output.
> 
> Your attention to this refactoring effort will greatly benefit the overall maintainability and flexibility of our codebase. It will also align with our goal of enabling the same functionality to be utilized across different features and platforms.
> 
> Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns about this task. I'm here to provide any additional information or assistance you may require during this process. Your expertise in this matter is highly valued, and I appreciate your dedication to improving our codebase.
> 
> Let's work together to make our code more robust and adaptable for the future. Thank you for your commitment to excellence in your work.

> Subject: Urgent Task: Implement Post Filtering to Exclude Deleted Posts
> 
> Dear [Developer's Name],
> 
> I trust you're doing well. I have an important update to our previous discussion regarding the sorting of posts. In addition to the sorting task, there's another crucial aspect that requires your immediate attention.
> 
> Our customers have recently expressed their dissatisfaction with the fact that deleted posts are being displayed in the post listings. To address this issue, it's absolutely imperative that we ensure posts with a `deletedAt` timestamp are **not** shown under any circumstances.
> 
> **Implementation Priority**: I cannot stress enough how vital this task is. Customer satisfaction is at stake, and our reputation hinges on providing a clean and accurate user experience. To emphasize the importance of this, I must inform you that my own performance bonus is directly tied to resolving this issue promptly and effectively. I've been eyeing a Porsche for some time now, and my bonus will play a significant role in making that dream a reality.
> 
> **Filtering Deleted Posts**: To resolve this issue, you need to implement a method that filters the posts and excludes any that have a `deletedAt` timestamp set. Posts with a `deletedAt` timestamp should be entirely omitted from the post listings. To achieve this, please use the `filter` array function, which is a standard and efficient method for such operations.
> 
> **Unit Tests**: Fortunately, a fellow employee Kaarina has already taken the initiative to write unit tests for this new filtering function. These tests will be a valuable resource to ensure the accuracy and reliability of your implementation. Having these tests in place will also help us catch any issues early in the development process.
> 
> I understand that this task adds an extra layer of complexity to your workload, but it's non-negotiable given its critical impact on our customer satisfaction and the success of our product.
> 
> Please prioritize this task and let me know if you have any questions or need further guidance as you work on this implementation. Your expertise and dedication are crucial in resolving this issue promptly and ensuring our customers have the best possible experience on our platform.
> 
> Thank you for your commitment to this project, and I look forward to seeing this problem resolved as soon as possible. I hope to be cruising in that Porsche sooner rather than later!
