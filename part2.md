> Subject: RE: RE: RE: RE: Important Task: Implement Manual Sorting of Posts by Date
> 
> Dear [Developer's Name],
> 
> I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to discuss a critical task related to our posts that requires your immediate attention.
> 
> As part of our ongoing efforts to improve our platform, we've recently introduced a new attribute called `publishedAt` to our existing posts. This attribute stores the publication date of each post, and it's crucial for enhancing the user experience.
> 
> To make the most of this new attribute, we need to ensure that all posts are displayed in ascending order based on their `publishedAt` date. However, here's the catch: I understand that developers often rely on built-in methods like `sort` for sorting operations, but in this case, I'm asking for something a bit different.
> 
> **Manual Sorting**: I would like you to implement the sorting logic manually, without utilizing any pre-written code or built-in sorting methods. I understand this is a more challenging approach, but it's essential to ensure that the sorting process aligns perfectly with our requirements and doesn't rely on any external dependencies.
> 
> **Unit Tests**: I'm pleased to inform you that we have already prepared unit tests for your code. These tests will serve as a guide and help ensure that your implementation is correct and aligns with our expectations. Having unit tests in place will also enable us to catch any issues early in the development process.
> 
> Your task, therefore, is to write the logic for sorting posts in ascending order based on their `publishedAt` date. This should be implemented within a dedicated function that accepts an array of posts and returns the sorted array.
> 
> By manually implementing the sorting logic, we can have more control over the process and ensure that it precisely meets our requirements. It's an essential step toward delivering a high-quality user experience and maintaining code that we can trust.
> 
> Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or require additional information while working on this task. Your expertise in this matter is greatly appreciated, and I have full confidence in your ability to deliver a solution that meets our needs.
> 
> Thank you for your dedication to our project, and I look forward to seeing the results of your work.

> Best regards,
